1.  cd to vagrant folder and run `vagrant up` before running.  
2. make a python virtualenv and install pip requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Be sure not to use `sudo` this time.  
3. ssh into vagrant and do the 2nd step there too. No need to make virtualenv here.    
4. That is it. (hopefully :P)
